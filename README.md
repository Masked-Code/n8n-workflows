# ðŸ§  n8n Workflows Collection

A personal collection of automated workflows built using [n8n](https://n8n.io), a powerful workflow automation tool that enables you to connect services and process data visually.

This repository will grow over time as I build and refine more workflows to automate my daily tasks, information gathering, and other useful routines.
